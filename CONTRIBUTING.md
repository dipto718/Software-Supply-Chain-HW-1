# Submitting Pull Requests

As this is a small project, when submitting
pull requests it is acceptable to email me
directly at ssd410@nyu.ed with a brief
summary regarding the purpose of the pull
request. To minimize excessive emails,
please review your own code to make sure
it meets the code style guide before
emailing me.

# Reporting Issues

Issues can be be reported in the security tab as
detailed in the reporting vulnerabilities section
of security.md. However, if the issue is major enough
it is appropriate to email me at ssd410@nyu.edu about it
so long as you are an approved contributer to the project.
Non-contributers are subject to having their email addresses
blocked unless they are emailing regarding their report not
being addressed even after a week.

# Adhering to code style Guides

We are adhereing to pep 8 in regards to the style of the python
code.

# Testing requirements

Before submitting any code, make sure you have tested it for bugs on your
local machine first. In addition, use a formatter like ruff to make sure
that the code is compliant with pep 8. In addition, make sure to use
a linter, type checker, and SAST tool to make sure that yor code is as
refined as possible during testing. Following these reqirements will make
sure that fewer issues will emerge in the future after the code has been
sbmitted.

# Contributer expectations
Contributers are expected to be respectful towards each other when working
on the project. They are also encouraged to avoid excessive emails to other
contributers about the project as that may result in them being treated as spam.
Only use direct emails for extremely important issues, otherwise report
issues in the security tab as outlined in secrity.md.

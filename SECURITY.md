# Security Policy

The general policy for security is that reported vulnerabilities
should be resolved within a week of them being reported on average.
However, it shold be aknowledged that more complex vulnerabilities
could take longer to resolve depending on their scale. In that case
it is acceptable to email me directly at ssd410@nyu.edu to get an
update on resolving the more complex vulnerability if you were the
the one submitted the initial report.

## Supported Versions

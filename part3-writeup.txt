I first installed git-filter-repo by cloning the repo and then
and then adding it to path. Installation was verified with --version.
Commands:
git clone https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo.git
cd git-filter-repo
sudo cp git-filter-repo /usr/local/bin/
git filter-repo --version

I then removed personal.txt with the following command:
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path personal.txt --force

I then temporarily disabled the branch protections I did
to execute the push to the remote repo. I also had to add back 
https://github.com/dipto718/Software-Supply-Chain-HW-1.git
as the origin as the previous command seemed to have deleted
it. The push had to be run with --force as it was intially
rejected likely because of the operations filter-repo had to
do to remove personal.txt from the commit history.
Commands:
git remote add origin https://github.com/dipto718/Software-Supply-Chain-HW-1.git
git push origin main --force

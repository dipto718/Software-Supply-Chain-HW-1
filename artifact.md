NetID: ssd410

Note:
I signed the artifact with my github account which is connected to both my nyu mail and gmail. When I looked as the signature record on search.sigstore.dev using the log index 544180575, the certificate seemed to default to my gmail rather nyu email. This is likely since my github account was initially made with my gmail and I then later attached my nyu email to it. I checked github settings and saw that this caused my gmail to be set as my primary email address and that why it was used for the signature. Therefore, I set my nyu mail as my primary github email and signed again so that the certificate for the signature would include ssd410@nyu.edu instead of my gmail.
